<p>My Portfolio</p>

<h2>
<a id="hi-there" class="anchor" href="#hi-there" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi There!</h2>

<p>I am Masters Student at San Jose State University, majoring in Computer Software Engineering. My Area of Specialization are Enterprise Software Technology and Cloud Computing &amp; Virtualization.</p>

<p>I have good academic experience in software development. During this tenure I had opportunity to learn various technologies including Java, REST, C#.NET, C, C++, Javascript, MongoDB, SQL, MySQL, Maven, Jersey and IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ and Greenfoot.
Having enrolled for a Diploma in Computer Engineering, I was exposed to various software development techniques at an early age, enabling me to have hands on experience on latest technologies.</p>

<p>In my bachelors with a team of 3 members, I even developed an Optical Character Recognition System that used our own designed algorithm. Moreover, other projects like “Payroll management system” and “Picture Editor” allowed us to play with Java and helped us understand Software development lifecycle. </p>

<p>In my first semester at San Jose State University, I enrolled for courses like Enterprise Software Platforms, Enterprise Distributed Systems and Systems Software Engineering which introduced me to concepts of Design Patterns and their applications, RESTful web services and concepts of Cloud computing. As a part of subjects, I have implemented projects like “Home Automation” wherein I was able to control home appliances via android application, ”Food Thrift” that used various APIs to provide information about discounts provided by the local grocery shops and “Sam the-Soldier” a 2D game that allowed us to implement various design patterns we learnt. Apart from projects completed in my academics, I engaged myself into hackathons which allowed me to improve in time management skills. During this time I was able to complete my first 3D game - “Relic Hunt” in Global Game Jam 2016.</p>
