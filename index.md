My Portfolio

## Hi There!
I am Software Engineering masters graduate from San Jose State University. My Area of Specialization is Enterprise Software Technology and Cloud computing.
I have excellent professional experience working with Shutterfly Inc. where I have experience working as an individual contributor. Here I was assigned development of web application that was capable communicating with JIRA, outlook services and slack. This opportunity also allowed me to experiment with technologies such as Dockers, Git version control and Grafana and graphite communication.
I am currently working as Software Engineer - Cloud in LG Electronics, where I am working on Cloud services, along with designing REST gateway for large number of consumers. I am also an integral part of CI/CD team for LG's backend servers and their maintenance. 
I have good academic experience in software development as well. During this tenure, I had the opportunity to learn various technologies including Java, Javascript, NodeJS, MongoDB, SQL, MySQL, Maven, Jersey and IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, Greenfoot and many other. I also have experience working on Dockers, cloud instances and Web application development.

## Projects

**Shopping Cart Service on Amazon Cloud and Heroku** (Technologies: Heroku, AWS, NodeJS, AngularJS, Cassandra, Redis, MongoDB, Neo4J)
github.com/cmpe281-team4/Heroku-Shopping-Cart-AWS-NoSQL-Service
*	Designed a cloud-based shopping cart like Amazon.com with multiple databases at back end to support various aspects of CAP properties
*	Maintained user sessions using Redis, supported Analytics and user activity log using Cassandra, designed Product catalog using MongoDB, making a recommendation system using Neo4J.
*	Scalable frontend UI rested on Heroku while the backend databases and NodeJS web server rested on EC2 with ELB used to scale the respective modules wherever required.
*	The main focus is on scalability, availability and failure tolerance.


**Project Fluffy** (Technologies: Netty, Protobuf, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Java)
github.com/jagrutipatil/ProjectFluffy
*	Engineered a MongoDB like distributed cluster using RAFT leader election algorithm to maintain consistency and partition tolerance that accepts key-value pair from client and stores it.
*	The project supported multiple databases Cassandra for unstructured and Postgres for structured to make sure that the user does not restrict itself to use single database
*	Designed internal as well as external CRUD operations to store, retrieve, delete and update the data and to maintain proper communication between the modules to provide consistency and availability to the user.


**Scalable NoSQL Database** (Technologies: Amazon AWS, Java, REST)
github.com/jagrutipatil/CMPE281_Cloud
* Created a database that supports CAP properties based on user requirement.
* Implemented a "three node" cluster of the database created on AWS EC2 instances to support both AP and CP properties based on user requirements.
* Supported external access by REST and internal replication supported by the system.
* Allowed user to determine the consistency level and let the user read-write operation quorum so as to make the database control in the hands of the user.

**Thrift –A Price Match Application** (Technologies: Android Studio, Google Messaging Service, MySQL)
github.com/Faisal9227/Food-Thrift-Application
* Developed an android application to notifies users on prices variation in subscribed store.
