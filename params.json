My Area of Specialization being Enterprise Software Technology want to apply for summer internship position as a Software Engineer.\r\n\r\nI have good academic experience in software development. During this tenure I had opportunity to learn various technologies including Java, REST, C#.NET, C, C++, Javascript, MongoDB, SQL, MySQL, Maven, Jersey and IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ and Greenfoot.\r\nHaving enrolled for a Diploma in Computer Engineering, I was exposed to various software development techniques at an early age, enabling me to have hands on experience on latest technologies.\r\n\r\nIn my bachelors with a team of 3 members, I even developed an Optical Character Recognition System that used our own designed algorithm. Moreover, other projects like “Payroll management system” and “Picture Editor” allowed us to play with Java and helped us understand Software development lifecycle. \r\n\r\nIn my first semester at San Jose State University, I enrolled for courses like Enterprise Software Platforms, Enterprise Distributed Systems and Systems Software Engineering which introduced me to concepts of Design Patterns and their applications, RESTful web services and concepts of Cloud computing. As a part of subjects, I have implemented projects like “Home Automation” wherein I was able to control home appliances via android application, ”Food Thrift” that used various APIs to provide information about discounts provided by the local grocery shops and “Sam the-Soldier” a 2D game that allowed us to implement various design patterns we learnt. Apart from projects completed in my academics, I engaged myself into hackathons which allowed me to improve in time management skills. During this time I was able to complete my first 3D game - “Relic Hunt” in Global Game Jam 2016.\r\n\r\n##Technical Skills\r\n* **Programming Languages**: Strong foundation in Java, C, C++, C#, REST, Tomcat, HTML5, CSS; familiarity with JavaScript, Design Patterns, MAVEN and Jersey \r\n* **Operating Systems**: Linux, Windows \r\n* **Databases**: MySQL, DB2, MongoDB \r\n* **Software**: Eclipse; Visual Studio; IntelliJ IDEA; Greenfoot \r\n* **Other Skills**: Design Patterns, Agile Methodologies \r\n\r\n\r\n##Education\r\n* **San Jose State University** MS - Computer Software Engineering (August 2015 - Present)\r\n* **University of Pune** BE - Computer Engineering (August 2011 - May 2014)\r\n* **Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education** Diploma in Computer Engineering (July 2008 – May 2011) \r\n\r\n##Publications\r\n* Optical Character Recognition Implementation using pattern matching (April 2014)\t                         http://www.ijcsit.com/docs/Volume%205/vol5issue02/ijcsit20140502254.pdf\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\n**Shopping Cart Service on Amazon Cloud and Heroku** (Technologies: Heroku, AWS, NodeJS, AngularJS, Cassandra, Redis, MongoDB, Neo4J)\r\n\r\n* Designed a cloud-based shopping cart like Amazon.com\r\n* Multiple databases at back end to support various aspects of CAP properties\r\n* Maintained user sessions using Redis, Supporting Analytics and user activity log using Cassandra, designing Product catalog using mongoDB, making a recommendation system using Neo4J.\r\n* The frontend scalable UI rests on Heroku while the backend databases and NodeJS web server rest on EC2 while ELB used to scale the respective modules wherever required.\r\n* The main focus is on scalability, availability and failure tolerance.\r\n\r\n**Project Fluffy** (Technologies: Netty, Protobuf, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Java)\r\n\r\n* Designed a MongoDB like distributed cluster that accepts key value pair from client and stores it.\r\n* Implemented RAFT leader election algorithm to maintain consistency and partition tolerance.\r\n* The project supported multiple databases so as to make sure that the user does not restrict itself to use single database\r\n* Designed internal as well as external CRUD operations to store, retrieve, delete and update the data and to maintain proper communication between the modules so as to provide consistency and availability to the user.\r\n\r\n**Scalable NoSQL Database** (Technologies: Amazon AWS, Java, REST)\r\n\r\n* Created a database that supports CAP properties based on user requirement.\r\n* Implemented a \"three node\" cluster of the database created on AWS EC2 instances to support both AP and CP properties based on user requirements.\r\n* External access is supported by REST and internal replication supported by the system.\r\n* Allowed user to determine the consistency level and let the user read-write operation quorum so as to make the database control in the hands of the user.\r\n\r\n**Thrift –A Price Match Application** (Technologies: Android Studio, Google Messaging Service, MySQL)\r\n\r\n* Developed an android application to notifies users on prices variation in subscribed store.\r\n* Used Google Messaging Service for to generate a notification when a new product is added by the stores or price changed.\r\n* The store APIs were used for this purpose making it a thin client.\r\n* The backend was supported by PHP and MySQL to make sure that the data received is structured.\r\n\r\n**Home Automation** (Technologies: Java, NodeJS, Amazon EC2, Google Maps API, REST, MongoDB, Maven)\r\n\r\n* Design and implemented IOT system that enables users to control home appliances using LWM2M model.\r\n* Developed a lightweight web application for the mobile phone that tracks user location and has basic controls for user facilities modeled data, maintained a database and implemented REST calls such as a device on/off so as to control client devices remotely.\r\n* Handled server side database that stores user location and appropriate actions to be performed\r\n\r\n**“Combat Fighter”-Game**, San Jose State University\r\n\r\nDeveloped an 2D Game using Greenfoot \r\n* Worked on game sprites.\r\n* Implemented the all the actions for the actor-“soldier”.\r\n* Worked on things such as difficulty level, score board and health bar.\r\n\r\n**UML Parser**, San Jose State University\r\n\r\nA java application that parses java code an generates corresponding class diagram\r\n* Designed algorithm to parse the java file and extract components such as class name, variable name, and function name\r\n* Implemented the algorithm in java\r\n* Created class diagrams for the input java code  \r\n\r\n**Optical Character Recognition**, University of Pune\r\n   \r\nDeveloped an application using C#.net to generate an editable text from image\r\n* Designed algorithm to recognize the characters in the image\r\n* Implemented the algorithm using C#\r\n* Managed the database that stored the values for respective sectors and tracks\r\n\r\n**Payroll Management System**, University of Pune \r\n\r\nApplication to manage salaries and HR information using Java\r\n* Designed data management techniques to manage employee details\r\n* Implemented the complete business logic in JAVA for the same\r\n\r\n**System Tuner**, Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education\r\n\r\nApplication to provide all system tuning utilities on one click\r\n* Designed business logic to delete useless files and temporary files.\r\n* Implemented logic to clear the browsing history and cookies.",
